# Abdominal Pain Home Care

- Start with small sips of clear fluids and eat bland foods as tolerated.
- Avoid NSAIDs on an empty stomach; check existing prescriptions for duplication.
- Seek urgent care if pain is severe, spreads to the chest or back, or if you have fever, blood in stool, or persistent vomiting.
