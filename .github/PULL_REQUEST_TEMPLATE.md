## Outcome
<!--
One sentence focused on the user impact. Avoid code- or implementation-speak.
Example: “Meds onset questions now return a sourced fact sheet instead of a generic LLM summary.”
-->

## Demo
<!--
Provide runnable steps that take ≤90 seconds. Prefer a CLI snippet (curl, pytest, make)
that someone can paste to verify the change end-to-end.
Example:
```bash
venv/bin/pytest --no-cov services/api/tests/integration/test_api_integration.py::test_meds_onset_hebrew_uses_med_facts
```
-->

## Acceptance
- [ ] Tests: <!-- List updated/added tests (e.g., `services/api/tests/unit/test_med_facts.py::test_onset_for_alias_hebrew_language`) -->
- [ ] Docs: <!-- Link to updated docs or say “N/A” -->
- [ ] Not demoable: <!-- If you cannot demo, explain why and next steps (≤3 days). Leave blank when demo is provided. -->
