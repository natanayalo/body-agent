feat: Enhance ML risk classifier and refine alert logic

This commit refines the ML risk classifier and alert mechanisms.

Key changes include:
- Updated `risk_ml.py` for multi-label classification with per-label thresholds and detailed debug output.
- Modified `health.py` to make interaction alerts conditional on multiple user medications.
- Gated the critic banner in `critic.py` based on ML risk assessment.
