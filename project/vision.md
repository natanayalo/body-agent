Here’s how to *actually* ship something with LangGraph + Elasticsearch, keep data private, and still have room to expand.

# 1) “Body Agent” — Personal Health & Life Copilot (care + planning, private by default)

## What it does (v1 scope)

* Keeps a **private memory** of you (meds, allergies, routines, calendar, preferences).
* Answers “What should I do now?”-type questions by **combining** your data + public guidance.
* Handles *light* automation: reminders, calendar slots, checklists, re-order refills, etc.

## Agent graph (LangGraph)

* **Supervisor/Router** – routes each turn to the right specialists based on intent & confidence.
* **Private Memory Agent** – retrieves your facts from a **local, encrypted** ES index (see privacy below).
* **Health Advisor Agent** – RAG on vetted public sources (drug monographs, symptom guides) with strict disclaimers; outputs safe next-steps.
* **Planner/Scheduler Agent** – merges advice with your time constraints (calendar MCP, todo MCP) and proposes a plan.
* **Web/Places Agent** – finds nearby clinics, pharmacies, labs; returns options with hours/ETA.
* **Security/PII Scrubber** – redacts identifiers before anything ever leaves the device; blocks unsafe tool calls.

> You can grow this later with “Vendors/Services Agent”, “Paperwork Explainer Agent”, etc.

## Elasticsearch layout

**Two indices** (both vector-enabled):

* `private_user_memory` (LOCAL): `entity`, `attribute`, `value`, `source`, `confidence`, `TTL`, `updated_at`.
  Examples:

  * (`medication`, `name`, “Atorvastatin 20mg”)
  * (`allergy`, `penicillin`, true)
  * (`preference`, `exercise_time`, “07:00–07:30\`)
* `public_health_and_places` (LOCAL or CLOUD you control): drug leaflets (e.g., DailyMed-like), basic triage guides, nearby providers, opening hours.
  Store dense embeddings + metadata (jurisdiction, freshness, source URL).

**Query pattern (dual-RAG):**
Router → retrieve **personal claims** (what’s true about *you*) → retrieve **public facts** (what’s true in general / nearby) → reason over both → propose plan.

## Privacy model (practical)

* **Local-first:** run ES in Docker *on the user’s machine/phone* or on a home server.
* **Client-held keys:** when cloud is unavoidable, encrypt docs client-side (e.g., libsodium/PASETO/JWE). Server never sees plaintext.
* **Zero-retention prompts:** assemble tool/LLM prompts **on device**; redact PII; never log raw prompts.
* **Field TTLs:** sensitive items in `private_user_memory` expire (e.g., location breadcrumbs = 24h).
* **Audit events:** every tool call captured locally for the user to review.

## MVP (2–3 weeks)

1. **LangGraph skeleton**: Supervisor + (Private Memory, Health Advisor, Planner).
2. **Local ES** with two indices; small seed corpus (10–50 drug monographs, 50–100 clinic entries).
3. **Flows to ship**:

   * “Remind me meds + flag interactions”
   * “Find earliest lab near me and add to calendar”
   * “I have X symptom—what should I do tonight?” (advice + red flags + care options)
4. **Hard guardrails**: medical disclaimer + escalation triggers (e.g., chest pain → emergency banner).

# 2) “Product Explorer” — Decision copilot for purchases (specs, availability, where to buy)

## What it does (v1 scope)

* Answers: **“What’s the best \_ for \_?”**, **“Is there a product that can \_?”**, **“Where to buy \_ in \_?”**
* Pulls specs/reviews/prices from open catalogs & retailer pages, normalizes them, ranks with your constraints, and surfaces **buy options**.

## Agent graph (LangGraph)

* **Query Understanding Agent** – extracts attributes & constraints (budget, size, use case, region).
* **Sourcing/Spider Agent** – pulls candidate products (APIs where available, consented scraping, public datasets).
* **Spec Normalizer Agent** – parses pages into a unified schema (brand/model/specs/price/stock/ship ETA).
* **Deduper/Entity Resolver** – merges duplicates across stores (UPC/EAN, fuzzy model matching).
* **Scoring/Ranker Agent** – multi-criteria ranking (e.g., TOPSIS/AHP-lite): weights specs, reliability, price, warranty, user prefs.
* **Summarizer & Buyer Agent** – explains trade-offs, outputs a *shortlist with citations & purchase links*, sets price-drop alerts.

## Elasticsearch layout

* `product_docs`: each product/store page as a doc with text + structured JSON; embeddings for semantic retrieval (e.g., “quiet robot vacuum for pets”).
* `spec_kb`: normalized spec tuples for fast filtering (RAM ≥ 16GB, weight < 1.5kg, etc.).
* `region_inventory`: per-region availability/price snapshots (timestamped) for “where to buy in X”.

**Flow:** Query → semantic search in `product_docs` → parse & normalize → rank → present 3–5 options → optionally set alerts.

## Data sources & reality checks

* Prefer official APIs (affiliate, search, GTIN/UPC registries).
* Use cached snapshots to avoid hammering sites; obey robots/TOS.
* Start with 1–2 categories (e.g., **coffee machines** or **strollers**) to nail parsing + ranking.

## MVP (2–3 weeks)

1. Ship **one category** end-to-end (say, drip coffee makers):

   * 100–300 SKUs across 5–8 stores.
   * Attributes to normalize (power, capacity, pressure, footprint, noise).
2. Queries to support:

   * “Best under ₪X / \$X”
   * “Quietest for small kitchen”
   * “Where to buy Breville XYZ in Tel Aviv / NYC today”
3. Output: **ranked table + why**, links, and a **price-watch toggle**.

# Shared platform (so you can build *both* with one core)

* **LangGraph supervision** with conditional edges + retries.
* **ES as the retrieval backbone**:

  * Private index (encrypted) for you/health.
  * Public/product indices for catalogs & places.
* **MCP tools** for: Calendar (ICS), Email/Tasks, Web fetcher, Geocoding/Places, Price alerts.
* **Memory graph**: store personal preferences once (budget range, brands, dietary limits, accessibility needs) and reuse across both apps.
* **Policy layer**: PII redaction, consent gates (“allow using location for this query?”), jurisdiction flags (health/legal warnings).
