Here’s a crisp next-step plan you can ship as a sequence of small PRs, each with concrete acceptance criteria and code pointers.

---

Refer to `project/roadmap/shipped.md` for completed slices.

> **Legend:** `owner:` GitHub handle · `status:` TODO | IN-PROGRESS | REVIEW | SHIPPED

_No active slices at the moment. Add the next planned PR entry here when you’re ready to start a new milestone item._

> **Numbering policy:** Section titles (e.g., “PR 36/37”) indicate planned order only. Actual PR numbers are assigned by GitHub once opened.
